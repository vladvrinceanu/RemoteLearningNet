# Custom HashTable

The fact that C# has a `Dictionary` class means that no C# programmer must write an implementation of hash tables from scratch ... unless, of course, you are a computer science student.

## Requirement

Write an implementation of hash tables from scratch. Define the following methods:

- `Get(key)`

- `Put(key, value)`

- `Remove(key)`

- `ContainsKey(key)`

- `Count()`

- an indexer

**Note:** Every Object has a hash code, so at least you don't have to define your own hash functions in the custom hash table implementation.

## Unit Tests

Write unit tests for each implemented method.
